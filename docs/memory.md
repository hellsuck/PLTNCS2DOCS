# Memory API

The `memory` table provides functions for low-level memory access and validation.

---

### `memory.read_i32(addr)`
Reads a 32-bit signed integer from the given address.
- **Parameters**: 
    - `addr` (`uintptr_t`): The address to read from.

---

### `memory.read_u32(addr)`
Reads a 32-bit unsigned integer from the given address.
- **Parameters**: 
    - `addr` (`uintptr_t`): The address to read from.

---

### `memory.read_f32(addr)`
Reads a 32-bit float from the given address.
- **Parameters**: 
    - `addr` (`uintptr_t`): The address to read from.

---

### `memory.read_ptr(addr)`
Reads a pointer (uint64) from the given address.
- **Parameters**: 
    - `addr` (`uintptr_t`): The address to read from.
- **Returns**: `uintptr_t`.

---

### `memory.is_valid(addr)`
Checks if a memory address is valid and accessible.
- **Parameters**: 
    - `addr` (`uintptr_t`): The address to validate.
- **Returns**: `bool`.
